GPA calculator for undergraduate students.

Undergraduates always worry about their current GPA and how to achieve their targeted GPA.
To help them with this, you are asked to build a GPA calculator that allows undergraduates to
keep track of their GPA over their undergraduate period.
I have developed a Java command-line interface application for the GPA calculator
and should use a MySQL database to persist data.

There are two main features of this simple application.
● Store previous course modules’ credits and results
● Calculate current GPA

Users should be able to
● Add/Update/Delete course details (course code, credits) and their grade
● View added course details
● View GPA value for each year
● View overall GPA
